First, issues related to thedescription of end-effector tasks that involve constrained motion and active force control are discussed. Thefundamentals of the operational space formulation are thenpresented, andthe unified approach for motion and force control is developed. The extension of this formulation to redundant manipulator systems is also presented,constructing the end-effector equations of motion and describing their behavior with respect to joint forces. These results are used in thedevelopment of a new and systematic approachfor dealing with the problems arising at kinematic singularitiesA. t a singular configuration, the manipulator is treated as a mechanismthat is redundant with respect to the motion of the end-effector in the subspace of operational space orthogonal to the singular direction.},

It is based on previous work on efficient O(N ) algorithms, where N is the number of links in the manipulator,and has been extended to includethe effects of a mobile base (the URV body). In addition, the various hydrodynamic forces exerted on these systems in underwater environments are also incorporated into the simulation. The effects modeled in this work are added mass,viscous drag, fiuid acceleration,and buoyancy forces. With emcient implementation of the resulting algorithm, the amount of computation with inclusion of the hydrodynamics is almost double that of the original algorithm for a six degree-of-freedom land-based manipulator with a mobile base. Nevertheless, the amount of computation still only grows linearly with the number of degrees of freedom in the manipulator.},

  abstract = {With the increasing complexity of humanoid mechanisms and their desired capabilities, there is a pressing need for a generalized framework where a desired whole-body motion behavior can be easily specified and controlled. Our hypothesis is that human motion results from simultaneously performing multiple objectives in a hierarchical manner, and we have analogously developed a prioritized, multiple-task control framework. The operational space formulation               10               provides dynamic models at the task level and structures for decoupled task and posture control.               13               This formulation allows for posture objectives to be controlled without dynamically interfering with the operational task. Achieving higher performance of posture objectives requires precise models of their dynamic behaviors. In this paper we complete the picture of task descriptions and whole-body dynamic control by establishing models of the dynamic behavior of secondary task objectives within the posture space. Using these models, we present a whole-body control framework that decouples the interaction between the task and postural objectives and compensates for the dynamics in their respective spaces.},

  abstract = {To synthesize whole-body behaviors interactively, multiple behavioral primitives need to be simultaneously controlled, including those that guarantee that the constraints imposed by the robot's structure and the external environment are satisfied. Behavioral primitives are entities for the control of various movement criteria, e.g. primitives describing the behavior of the center of gravity, the behaviors of the hands, legs, and head, the body attitude and posture, the constrained body parts such as joint-limits and contacts, etc. By aggregating multiple primitives, we synthesize whole-body behaviors. For safety and for efficient control, we establish a control hierarchy among behavioral primitives, which is exploited to establish control priorities among the different control categories, i.e. constraints, operational tasks, and postures. Constraints should always be guaranteed, while operational tasks should be accomplished without violating the acting constraints, and the posture should control the residual movement redundancy. In this paper, we will present a multi-level hierarchical control structure that allows the establishment of general priorities among behavioral primitives, and we will describe compliant control strategies for efficient control under contact interactions.},

Starting from the classical applications in position control of manipulators, the kinematic-based approaches have lately been applied to, e.g., visual servoing and quadruped or multirobot coordination control. A common approach consists in the definition of several tasks properly combined in priority. In this paper, by resorting to a Lyapunov-based stability discussion for several prioritized inverse kinematics algorithms, sufficient conditions for the control gains and the tasks’ design are given for the regulation problem. Two case studies show the practical implementation of the results.},

Then, a new task-priority redundancy resolution technique is developed that overcomes the effects of algorithmic singularities. Computational aspects of the solutions are also considered in view of real-time implementation of a kinematic control algorithm.
