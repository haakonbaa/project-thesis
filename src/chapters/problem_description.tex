The project considers nonlinear control methods for lightweight underwater vehicle-manipulator
systems (light-UVMSs) including both remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) with a lightweight
base, and articulated intervention-AUVs (AIAUVs) (e.g. underwater snake robots) which are
lightweight and with no separate base. Lightweight UVMSs are increasingly taken into use in
several industries, including harbor control and environmental monitoring.
Light-UVMSs reveal a control challenge which so far has been neglected: to efficiently
control a light-UVMS one should consider the coupling effects between its base and arm
motions. When the arm moves, this will make the base move as well, and vice versa. This
coupling is not so clear for large work-class ROVs where the motion of the heavy base can be
assumed almost decoupled from the motion of the arm. The coupling effects appear partly due
to both reaction forces and hydrostatic forces.
Since UVMSs possess both thrusters and a manipulator arm, these vehicles are considered
kinematically redundant. This kinematic redundancy makes them suitable for task-priority control, 
which can be categorized into kinematic-level and dynamic-level approaches. kinematic-level 
control does not explicitly consider all the coupling effects between the
manipulator and the base motions, whereas dynamic-level control does. However, one must
have a sufficiently accurate mathematical model of the UVMS to correctly apply dynamic-
level control. Currently there is a lack of research that compares these methods for underwater
vehicles, especially related to experimental validation.
Physical experiments involving NTNU's "Eelume 500" AIAUV have been planned for the spring of 2025. These experiments will explore and extend the state-of-the-art within task-priority control of light-UVMSs. To safely conduct these experiments, a thorough simulation study must be precede them, and software must be developed that allows implementing and simulating various task-priority control methods, with as low a sim-to-real-gap as possible. The task of this assignment is therefore to implement a simulation framework, suitable for simulating dynamics of underwater vehicles. The simulation framework should allow the implementation of model-based controllers, by exposing the system dynamic matrices for use in control synthesis. This framework shall be used to compare and implement various task-priority approaches for lightweight UVMS both theoretically and in simulation. The task-priority methods to compare should be decided by the student after a literature review.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do a literature survey on task-priority control for underwater vehicle manipulator
systems (UVMS), describe the state-of-the-art, with a focus on works with experimental
results.
\item Create a simulation framework for low-level (model-based) task priority control of light-UVMSs.
\item Do a simulation study comparing kinematic- and dynamic-level task-priority control
methods for light-UVMSs.
\end{enumerate}
