  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new scheme for redundancy control of robot manipulators. We introduce the concept of task priority in relation to the inverse kinematic problem of redundant robot manipulators. A required task is divided into subtasks according to the order of priority. We propose to determine the joint motions of robot manipulators so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing redundancy on subtasks with higher priority. This procedure is formulated using the pseudoinverses of Jacobian matrices. Most problems of redundancy utilization can be formulated in the framework of tasks with the order of priority. The results ofnumerical simulations and experiments show the effectiveness ofthe proposed redundancy control scheme.},

First, issues related to thedescription of end-effector tasks that involve constrained motion and active force control are discussed. Thefundamentals of the operational space formulation are thenpresented, andthe unified approach for motion and force control is developed. The extension of this formulation to redundant manipulator systems is also presented,constructing the end-effector equations of motion and describing their behavior with respect to joint forces. These results are used in thedevelopment of a new and systematic approachfor dealing with the problems arising at kinematic singularitiesA. t a singular configuration, the manipulator is treated as a mechanismthat is redundant with respect to the motion of the end-effector in the subspace of operational space orthogonal to the singular direction.},

First, the application of existing singularity-robust methods to the case of kinematically redundant arms is studied. Then, a new task-priority redundancy resolution technique is developed that overcomes the effects of algorithmic singularities. Computational aspects of the solutions are also considered in view of real-time implementation of a kinematic control algorithm. The method is applied to a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator in numerical case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {With the increasing complexity of humanoid mechanisms and their desired capabilities, there is a pressing need for a generalized framework where a desired whole-body motion behavior can be easily specified and controlled. Our hypothesis is that human motion results from simultaneously performing multiple objectives in a hierarchical manner, and we have analogously developed a prioritized, multiple-task control framework. The operational space formulation               10               provides dynamic models at the task level and structures for decoupled task and posture control.               13               This formulation allows for posture objectives to be controlled without dynamically interfering with the operational task. Achieving higher performance of posture objectives requires precise models of their dynamic behaviors. In this paper we complete the picture of task descriptions and whole-body dynamic control by establishing models of the dynamic behavior of secondary task objectives within the posture space. Using these models, we present a whole-body control framework that decouples the interaction between the task and postural objectives and compensates for the dynamics in their respective spaces.},

The proposed method guarantees strict priority among dierent groups of tasks such as safety-related, operational and optimization tasks. Moreover, a soft priority measure in the form of penalty parameters can be employed to prioritize tasks at the same priority level. As opposed to kinematic control schemes, the proposed framework is a holistic approach to control of redundant robotic systems, which solves the redundancy resolution, dynamic control and control allocation problems simultaneously. Numerical simulations of a hyper-redundant articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV) is presented to validate the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Cooperative control of autonomous underwater robots can provide capabilities that exceed those of any single marine robot. In this paper, the cooperation between two different underwater vehicle-manipulator systems is considered. Cooperation is enabled through a control scheme which generates state-dependent reference signals to achieve synchronization of the end-effector positions of the robots. These references are tracked by the individual control systems, which consist of decoupled kinematic and dynamic controllers. Consequently, the control systems do not constrain the choice of cooperation scheme. Due to the kinematic redundancy of the robots, a task-priority inverse kinematics controller is used for velocity-level redundancy resolution, and several tasks are defined for each robot. Furthermore, the dynamics of the robots are controlled by a higher-order sliding mode controller, namely the generalized super-twisting algorithm with adaptive gains. The dynamic control approach provides robustness to model uncertainties and unknown disturbances. The effectiveness of the methods is verified in a simulation study on a heterogeneous pair of UVMSs.},
